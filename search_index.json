is a fast data-driven router for Clojure(Script).\n\nSimple data-driven route syntax\nRoute conflict resolution\nFirst-class route data\nBi-directional routing\nPluggable coercion (schema & clojure.spec)\nExtendable\nModular\nFast\n\nThe following higher-level routers are also available as separate modules:\n\nreitit-ring with data-driven middleware\nreitit-http with enchanced Pedestal-style Interceptors (WIP)\nreitit-frontend with Keechma-style Controllers (WIP)\n\nTo use Reitit, add the following dependecy to your project:\n[metosin/reitit \"0.1.0\"]\n\nOptionally, the parts can be required separately:\n[metosin/reitit-core \"0.1.0\"] ; routing core\n[metosin/reitit-ring \"0.1.0\"] ; ring-router\n[metosin/reitit-spec \"0.1.0\"] ; spec coercion\n[metosin/reitit-schema \"0.1.0\"] ; schema coercion\n\nFor discussions, there is a #reitit channel in Clojurians slack.\nExamples\nSimple router\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n\n(def

Reitit separates routing and coercion into two separate steps.\nBy default, all wildcard and catch-all parameters are parsed into strings:\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [\"/:company/users/:user-id\" ::user-view]))\n\nMatch with the parsed :path-params as strings:\n(r/match-by-path r \"/metosin/users/123\")\n; #Match{:template \"/:company/users/:user-id\",\n;        :data {:name :user/user-view},\n;        :result nil,\n;        :path-params {:company \"metosin\", :user-id \"123\"},\n;        :path \"/metosin/users/123\"}\n\nTo enable parameter coercion, the following things need to be done:\n\nDefine a Coercion for the routes\nDefine types for the parameters\nCompile coercers for the types\nApply the coercion\n\nDefine Coercion\nreitit.coercion/Coercion is a protocol defining how types are defined, coerced and inventoried.\nReitit ships with the following coercion modules:\n\nreitit.coercion.schema/coercion for plumatic schema\nreitit.coercion.spec/coercion for both clojure.spec and data-specs\n\nCoercion can be attached to route data under :coercion key. There can be multiple Coercion implementations within a single router, normal scoping rules apply.\nDefining parameters\nRoute parameters can be defined via route data :parameters. It has keys for different type of parameters: :query, :body, :form, :header and :path. Syntax for the actual parameters depends on the Coercion implementation.\nExample with Schema path-parameters:\n(require '[reitit.coercion.schema])\n(require '[schema.core :as s])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [\"/:company/users/:user-id\" {:name ::user-view\n                                 :coercion reitit.coercion.schema/coercion\n                                 :parameters {:path {:company s/Str\n                                                     :user-id s/Int}}}]))\n\nA Match:\n(r/match-by-path r \"/metosin/users/123\")\n; #Match{:template \"/:company/users/:user-id\",\n;        :data {:name :user/user-view,\n;               :coercion >\n;               :parameters {:path {:company java.lang.String,\n;                                   :user-id Int}}},\n;        :result nil,\n;        :path-params {:company \"metosin\", :user-id \"123\"},\n;        :path \"/metosin/users/123\"}\n\nCoercion was not applied. Why? In Reitit, routing and coercion are separate processes and we have done just the routing part. We need to apply coercion after the successful routing.\nBut now we should have enough data on the match to apply the coercion.\nCompiling coercers\nBefore the actual coercion, we should need to compile the coercers against the route data. Compiled coercers yield much better performance and the manual step of adding a coercion compiler makes things explicit and non-magical.\nCompiling can be done via a Middleware, Interceptor or a Router.

It also ensures that all routes have a :handler defined. reitit.ring/ring-handler is used to create a Ring handler out of ring-router.\nExample\nSimple Ring app:\n(require '[reitit.ring :as ring])\n\n(defn handler [_]\n  {:status 200, :body \"ok\"})\n\n(def app\n  (ring/ring-handler\n    (ring/router\n      [\"/ping\" handler])))\n\nApplying the handler:\n(app {:request-method :get, :uri \"/favicon.ico\"})\n; nil\n\n(app {:request-method :get, :uri \"/ping\"})\n; {:status 200, :body \"ok\"}\n\nThe expanded routes shows the compilation results:\n(-> app (ring/get-router) (reitit/routes))\n; [[\"/ping\"\n;   {:handler #object[...]}\n;   #Methods{:any #Endpoint{:data {:handler #object[...]},\n;                           :handler #object[...],\n;                           :middleware []}}]]\n\nNote the compiled resuts as third element in the route vector.\nRequest-method based routing\nHandler are also looked under request-method keys: :get, :head, :patch, :delete, :options, :post or :put. Top-level handler is used if request-method based handler is not found.\n(def app\n  (ring/ring-handler\n    (ring/router\n      [\"/ping\" {:name ::ping\n                :get handler\n                :post handler}])))\n\n(app {:request-method :get, :uri \"/ping\"})\n; {:status 200, :body \"ok\"}\n\n(app {:request-method :put, :uri \"/ping\"})\n; nil\n\nName-based reverse routing:\n(-> app\n    (ring/get-router)\n    (reitit/match-by-name ::ping)\n    :path)\n; \"/ping\"\n\nMiddleware\nMiddleware can be added with a :middleware key, either to top-level or under :request-method submap.

To enable fast lookups into route data, we can compile them into any shape (records, functions etc.) we want, enabling fast access at request-time.\nBut, we can do much better. As we know the exact route that middleware/interceptor is linked to, we can pass the (compiled) route information into the middleware at creation-time. It can do local reasoning: extract and transform relevant data just for it and pass the optimized data into the actual request-handler via a closure - yielding much faster runtime processing. Middleware can also decide not to mount itself by returning nil. Why mount a wrap-enforce-roles middleware for a route if there are no roles required for it?\nTo enable this we use middleware records :compile key instead of the normal :wrap. :compile expects a function of route-data router-opts => ?IntoMiddleware.\nTo demonstrate the two approaches, below are response coercion middleware written as normal ring middleware function and as middleware record with :compile.\nNormal Middleware\n\nReads the compiled route information on every request.

Originally the routing was ported from Pedestal, but has been mostly rewritten to get even better performance.\nRationale\n\nMultiple routing algorithms, chosen based on the route tree\nRoute flattening and re-ordering\nManaged mutability over immutability\nPrecompute/compile as much as possible (matches, middleware, interceptors, routes)\nUse abstractions that enable JVM optimizations\nUse small functions to enable JVM Inlining\nProtocols over Multimethods\nRecords over Maps\nAlways be measuring\nDon't trust the (micro-)benchmarks\n\nDoes routing performance matter?\nWell, it depends. With small route trees, it might not. But, with large (real-life) route trees, difference between the fastest and the slowest tested libs can be two or three orders of magnitude. For busy sites it actually matters if you routing request takes 100 ns or 100 µs. A lot.\nTests\nAll perf tests are found in the repo and have been run with the following setup:\n;;\n;; start repl with `lein perf repl`\n;; perf measured with the following setup:\n;;\n;; Model Name:            MacBook Pro\n;; Model Identifier:      MacBookPro11,3\n;; Processor Name:        Intel Core i7\n;; Processor Speed:       2,5 GHz\n;; Number of Processors:  1\n;; Total Number of Cores: 4\n;; L2 Cache (per Core):   256 KB\n;; L3 Cache:              6 MB\n;; Memory:                16 GB\n;;\nNOTE: Tests are not scientific proof and may contain errors. You should always run the perf tests with your own (real-life) routing tables to get more accurate results for your use case. Also, if you have idea how to test things better, please let us know.\nSimple Example\nThe routing sample taken from bide README:\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n(require '[criterium.core :as cc])\n\n(def routes\n  (r/router\n    [[\"/auth/login\" :auth/login]\n     [\"/auth/recovery/token/:token\" :auth/recovery]\n     [\"/workspace/:project/:page\" :workspace/page]]))\n\n;; Execution time mean (per 1000) : 3.2 µs -> 312M ops/sec\n(cc/quick-bench\n  (dotimes [_ 1000]\n    (r/match-by-path routes \"/auth/login\")))\n\n;; Execution time mean (per 1000): 530 µs -> 1.9M ops/sec\n(cc/quick-bench\n  (dotimes [_ 1000]\n    (r/match-by-path routes \"/workspace/1/1\")))\n\nBased on the perf tests, the first (static path) lookup is 300-500x faster and the second (wildcard path) lookup is 4-24x faster that the other tested routing libs (Ataraxy, Bidi, Compojure and Pedestal).\nBut, the example is too simple for any real benchmark. Also, some of the libraries always match on the :request-method too and by doing so, do more work than just match by path. Compojure does most work also by invoking the handler.\nSo, we need to test something more realistic.\nRESTful apis\nTo get better view on the real life routing performance, there is test of a mid-size rest(ish) http api with 50+ routes, having a lot of path parameters. The route definitions are pulled off from the OpenSensors swagger definitions.\nThanks to the snappy new segment-tree algorithm, reitit-ring is fastest here. Pedestal is also fast with it's prefix-tree implementation.\n\nCQRS apis\nAnother real-life test scenario is a CQRS-style route tree, where all the paths are static, e.g. /api/command/add-order. The 300 route definitions are pulled out from Lupapiste.\nBoth reitit-ring and Pedestal shine in this test, thanks to the fast lookup-routers. On average, they are two and on best case, three orders of magnitude faster than the other tested libs. Ataraxy failed this test on Method code too large! error.\n\nNOTE: in real life, there are usually always also wild-card routes present. In this case, Pedestal would fallback from lookup-router to the prefix-tree router, which is order of magnitude slower (30x in this test). Reitit would handle this nicely thanks to it's :mixed-router: all static routes would still be served with :lookup-router, just the wildcard routes with :segment-tree. The performance would not notably degrade.\nWhy measure?\nThe reitit routing perf is measured to get an internal baseline to optimize against. We also want to ensure that new features don't regress the performance. Perf tests should be run in a stable CI environment. Help welcome!\nLooking out of the box\nA quick poke to routers in Go indicates that the reitit is only few times slower than the fastest routers in Go. Which is really awesome (if true).\nPerformance tips\nFew things that have an effect on performance:\n\nWildcard-routes are an order of magnitude slower than static routes\nIt's ok to mix non-wildcard and wildcard routes in a same routing tree as long as you don't disable the conflict resolution => if no conflicting routes are found, a :mixed-router can be created, which internally has a fast static path router and a separate wildcard-router. So, the static paths are still fast.\nMove computation from request processing time into creation time, using by compiling middleware & route data.\nUnmounted middleware (or interceptor) is infinitely faster than a mounted one effectively doing nothing.\n\n\n\n"},"interceptors.html":{"url":"interceptors.html","title":"Interceptors (WIP)","keywords":"","body":"Interceptors (WIP)\nReitit has also support for Pedestal-style interceptors via reitit.interceptor package.

There are already many good routing libs for Clojure, but we felt none was perfect. So, we took best parts of existing libs and added features that were missing: first-class composable route data, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion. Goal was to make a data-driven library that works, is fun to use and is really, really fast.\nHow can I contribute?\nYou can join #reitit channel in Clojurians slack to discuss things. Known roadmap is mostly written in issues.\nHow does Reitit differ from Bidi?\nBidi is an great and proven library for ClojureScript and we have been using it in many of our frontend projects. Both Reitit and Bidi are data-driven, bi-directional and work with both Clojure & ClojureScript. Here are the main differences:\nRoute syntax\n\nBidi supports multiple representations for route syntax, Reitit supports just one (simple) syntax.\nBidi uses special (Clojure) syntax for route patterns while Reitit separates (human-readable) paths strings from route data - still exposing the machine-readable syntax for extensions.\n\nBidi:\n(def routes\n  [\"/\" [[\"auth/login\" :auth/login]\n        [[\"auth/recovery/token/\" :token] :auth/recovery]\n        [\"workspace/\" [[[:project-uuid \"/\" :page-uuid] :workspace/page]]]]])\n\nReitit:\n(def routes\n  [[\"/auth/login\" :auth/login]\n   [\"/auth/recovery/token/:token\" :auth/recovery]\n   [\"/workspace/:project-uuid/:page-uuid\" :workspace/page]])\n\nFeatures\n\nBidi has extra features like route guards\nReitit ships with composable route data, specs, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion.\n\nPerformance\n\nBidi is not optimized for speed and thus, Reitit is much faster than Bidi. From Bidi source:\n\n;; Route compilation was only marginally effective and hard to\n;; debug. When bidi matching takes in the order of 30 micro-seconds,\n;; this is good enough in relation to the time taken to process the\n;; overall request.\n\nHow does Reitit differ from Pedestal?\nPedestal is an great and proven library and has had great influence in Reitit. Both Reitit and Pedestal are data-driven and provide bi-directional routing and fast. Here are the main differences:\nClojureScript\n\nPedestal targets only Clojure, while Reitit works also with ClojureScript.\n\nRoute syntax\n\nPedestal supports multiple representations for route syntax: terse, table and verbose. Reitit provides only one representation.\nPedestal supports both maps or keyword-arguments in route data, in Reitit, it's all maps.\n\nPedestal:\n[\"/api/ping\" :get identity :route-name ::ping]\n\nReitit:\n[\"/api/ping\" {:get identity, :name ::ping}]\n\nFeatures\n\nPedestal supports route guards\nPedestal supports interceptors (reitit-http module will support them too).\nReitit ships with composable route data, specs, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion.\nIn Pedestal, different routers behave differently, in Reitit, all work the same.\n\nPerformance\nReitit routing was originally based on Pedestal Routing an thus they same similar performance. For routing trees with both static and wildcard routes, Reitit is much faster thanks to it's mixed-router algorithm.\nHow does Reitit differ from Compojure?\nCompojure is the most used routing library in Clojure. It's proven and awesome.\nClojureScript\n\nCompojure targets only Clojure, while Reitit works also with ClojureScript.\n\nRoute syntax\n\nCompojure uses routing functions and macros while reitit is all data\nCompojure allows easy destructuring of route params on mid-path\nApplying middleware for sub-paths is hacky on Compojure, reitit-ring resolves this with data-driven middleware\n\nCompojure:\n(defroutes routes\n  (wrap-routes\n    (context \"/api\" []\n      (GET \"/users/:id\" [id :\nreitit-ring with reitit-spec module:\n(def routes\n  [\"/api\" {:middleware [[wrap-api :secure]]}\n   [\"/users/:id\" {:get {:parameters {:path {:id int?}}}\n                  :handler (fn [{:keys [parameters]}]\n                             (ok (get-user (-> parameters :body :id))))}\n    [\"/pizza\" {:post {:middleware [wrap-log]\n                      :handler post-pizza-handler}]]])\n\nFeatures\n\nDynamic routing is trivial in Compojure, with reitit, some trickery is needed\nReitit ships with composable route data, specs, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion.\n\nPerformance\nReitit is much faster than Compojure.\n"}}}
