Expansion can be customized either by swapping the :expand implementation or by extending the Protocol. r/Expand implementations can be recursive.\nNaive example to add direct support for java.io.File route argument:\n(extend-type java.io.File\n  r/Expand\n  (expand [file options]\n    (r/expand\n      #(slurp file)\n      options)))\n\n(r/router\n  [\"/\" (java.io.File. \"index.html\")])\n\nPage shared routes has an example of an custom :expand implementation.\nRoute data validation\nSee Route data validation.\n"},"basics/route_data_validation.html":{"url":"basics/route_data_validation.html","title":"Route Data Validation","keywords":"","body":"Route Data Validation\nRoute data can be anything, so it's easy to go wrong.

Reitit separates routing and coercion into two separate steps.\nBy default, all wildcard and catch-all parameters are parsed into strings:\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [\"/:company/users/:user-id\" ::user-view]))\n\nMatch with the parsed :path-params as strings:\n(r/match-by-path r \"/metosin/users/123\")\n; #Match{:template \"/:company/users/:user-id\",\n;        :data {:name :user/user-view},\n;        :result nil,\n;        :path-params {:company \"metosin\", :user-id \"123\"},\n;        :path \"/metosin/users/123\"}\n\nTo enable parameter coercion, the following things need to be done:\n\nDefine a Coercion for the routes\nDefine types for the parameters\nCompile coercers for the types\nApply the coercion\n\nDefine Coercion\nreitit.coercion/Coercion is a protocol defining how types are defined, coerced and inventoried.\nReitit ships with the following coercion modules:\n\nreitit.coercion.schema/coercion for plumatic schema\nreitit.coercion.spec/coercion for both clojure.spec and data-specs\n\nCoercion can be attached to route data under :coercion key. There can be multiple Coercion implementations within a single router, normal scoping rules apply.\nDefining parameters\nRoute parameters can be defined via route data :parameters. It has keys for different type of parameters: :query, :body, :form, :header and :path. Syntax for the actual parameters depends on the Coercion implementation.\nExample with Schema path-parameters:\n(require '[reitit.coercion.schema])\n(require '[schema.core :as s])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [\"/:company/users/:user-id\" {:name ::user-view\n                                 :coercion reitit.coercion.schema/coercion\n                                 :parameters {:path {:company s/Str\n                                                     :user-id s/Int}}}]))\n\nA Match:\n(r/match-by-path r \"/metosin/users/123\")\n; #Match{:template \"/:company/users/:user-id\",\n;        :data {:name :user/user-view,\n;               :coercion >\n;               :parameters {:path {:company java.lang.String,\n;                                   :user-id Int}}},\n;        :result nil,\n;        :path-params {:company \"metosin\", :user-id \"123\"},\n;        :path \"/metosin/users/123\"}\n\nCoercion was not applied. Why? In Reitit, routing and coercion are separate processes and we have done just the routing part. We need to apply coercion after the successful routing.\nBut now we should have enough data on the match to apply the coercion.\nCompiling coercers\nBefore the actual coercion, we should need to compile the coercers against the route data. Compiled coercers yield much better performance and the manual step of adding a coercion compiler makes things explicit and non-magical.\nCompiling can be done via a Middleware, Interceptor or a Router. We apply it now at router-level, effecting all routes (with :parameters and :coercion defined).\nThere is a helper function reitit.coercion/compile-request-coercers just for this:\n(require '[reitit.coercion :as coercion])\n(require '[reitit.coercion.schema])\n(require '[schema.core :as s])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [\"/:company/users/:user-id\" {:name ::user-view\n                                 :coercion reitit.coercion.schema/coercion\n                                 :parameters {:path {:company s/Str\n                                                     :user-id s/Int}}}]\n    {:compile coercion/compile-request-coercers}))\n\nRouting again:\n(r/match-by-path r \"/metosin/users/123\")\n; #Match{:template \"/:company/users/:user-id\",\n;        :data {:name :user/user-view,\n;               :coercion >\n;               :parameters {:path {:company java.lang.String,\n;                                   :user-id Int}}},\n;        :result {:path #object[reitit.coercion$request_coercer$]},\n;        :path-params {:company \"metosin\", :user-id \"123\"},\n;        :path \"/metosin/users/123\"}\n\nThe compiler added a :result key into the match (done just once, at router creation time), which holds the compiled coercers. We are almost done.\nApplying coercion\nWe can use a helper function reitit.coercion/coerce! to do the actual coercion, based on a Match:\n(coercion/coerce!\n  (r/match-by-path router \"/metosin/users/123\"))\n; {:path {:company \"metosin\", :user-id 123}}\n\nWe get the coerced paremeters back. If a coercion fails, a typed (:reitit.coercion/request-coercion) ExceptionInfo is thrown, with data about the actual error:\n(coercion/coerce!\n  (r/match-by-path router \"/metosin/users/ikitommi\"))\n; => ExceptionInfo Request coercion failed:\n; #CoercionError{:schema {:company java.lang.String, :user-id Int, Any Any},\n;                :errors {:user-id (not (integer? \"ikitommi\"))}}\n; clojure.core/ex-info (core.clj:4739)\n\nFull example\nHere's a full example for doing routing and coercion with Reitit and Schema:\n(require '[reitit.coercion.schema])\n(require '[reitit.coercion :as coercion])\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n(require '[schema.core :as s])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [\"/:company/users/:user-id\" {:name ::user-view\n                                 :coercion reitit.coercion.schema/coercion\n                                 :parameters {:path {:company s/Str\n                                                     :user-id s/Int}}}]\n    {:compile coercion/compile-request-coercers}))\n\n(defn match-by-path-and-coerce!

There can be multiple Coercion implementations within a single router, normal scoping rules apply.\nDefining parameters and responses\nParameters are defined in route data under :parameters key. It's value should be a map of parameter :type -> Coercion Schema.\nResponses are defined in route data under :responses key. It's value should be a map of http status code to a map which can contain :body key with Coercion Schema as value.\nBelow is an example with Plumatic Schema. It defines schemas for :query, :body and :path parameters and for http 200 response :body.\nHandler can access the coerced parameters can be read under :parameters key in the request.\n(require '[reitit.coercion.schema])\n(require '[schema.core :as s])\n\n(def PositiveInt (s/constrained s/Int pos?

To enable fast lookups into route data, we can compile them into any shape (records, functions etc.) we want, enabling fast access at request-time.\nBut, we can do much better. As we know the exact route that middleware/interceptor is linked to, we can pass the (compiled) route information into the middleware at creation-time. It can do local reasoning: extract and transform relevant data just for it and pass the optimized data into the actual request-handler via a closure - yielding much faster runtime processing. Middleware can also decide not to mount itself by returning nil. Why mount a wrap-enforce-roles middleware for a route if there are no roles required for it?\nTo enable this we use middleware records :compile key instead of the normal :wrap. :compile expects a function of route-data router-opts => ?IntoMiddleware.\nTo demonstrate the two approaches, below are response coercion middleware written as normal ring middleware function and as middleware record with :compile.\nNormal Middleware\n\nReads the compiled route information on every request.

If the identity changes from the previous value, controller\nis reinitialized: stop and start get called again.\nYou can add controllers to a route by adding them to the route data in the\n:controllers vector. For example:\n[\"/item/:id\"\n {:controllers [{:parameters {:path [:id]}\n                 :start  (fn [parameters] (js/console.log :start (-> parameters :path :id)))\n                 :stop   (fn [parameters] (js/console.log :stop (-> parameters :path :id)))}]}]\n\nYou can leave out start or stop if you do not need both of them.\nEnabling controllers\nYou need to\ncall\nreitit.frontend.controllers/apply-controllers whenever\nthe URL changes.

Consider this route tree:\n[\"/\" {:controllers [{:start (fn [_] (js/console.log \"root start\"))}]}\n [\"/item/:id\"\n  {:controllers [{:params (fn [match] (get-in match [:path-params :id]))\n                  :start  (fn [item-id] (js/console.log \"item start\" item-id))\n                  :stop   (fn [item-id] (js/console.log \"item stop\" item-id))}]}]]\n\n\nWhen you navigate to any route at all, the root controller gets started.\nIf you navigate to /item/something, the root controller gets started first\nand then the item controller gets started.\nIf you then navigate from /item/something to /item/something-else, first\nthe item controller gets stopped with parameter something and then it gets\nstarted with the parameter something-else. The root controller stays on the\nwhole time since its parameters do not change.\n\nTips\nAuthentication\nControllers can be used to load resources from a server. If and when your\nAPI requires authentication you will need to implement logic to prevent controllers\ntrying to do requests if user isn't authenticated yet.\nRun controllers and check authentication\nIf you have both unauthenticated and authenticated resources, you can\nrun the controllers always and then check the authentication status\non controller code, or on the code called from controllers (e.g. re-frame event\nhandler).\nDisable controllers until user is authenticated\nIf all your resources require authentication an easy way to prevent bad\nrequests is to enable controllers only after authentication is done.\nTo do this you can check authentication status and call apply-controllers\nonly after authentication is done (also remember to manually call apply-controllers\nwith current match when authentication is done). Or if no navigation is possible\nbefore authentication is done, you can start the router only after\nauthentication is done.\nAlternatives\nSimilar solution could be used to describe required resources as data (maybe\neven GraphQL query) per route, and then have code automatically load\nmissing resources.\nControllers elsewhere\n\nControllers in Keechma\n\n"},"advanced/configuring_routers.html":{"url":"advanced/configuring_routers.html","title":"Configuring Routers","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Routers\nRouters can be configured via options.

For this, the Router protocol exposes it's resolved routes via r/routes and options via r/options.\nAdding routes\nLet's create a router:\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [[\"/foo\" ::foo]\n     [\"/bar/:id\" ::bar]]))\n\nWe can query the resolved routes and options:\n(r/routes router)\n;[[\"/foo\" {:name :user/foo}]\n; [\"/bar/:id\" {:name :user/bar}]]\n\n(r/options router)\n;{:lookup #object[...]\n; :expand #object[...]\n; :coerce #object[...]\n; :compile #object[...]\n; :conflicts #object[...]}\n\nLet's add a helper function to create a new router with extra routes:\n(defn add-routes [router routes]\n  (r/router\n    (into (r/routes router) routes)\n    (r/options router)))\n\nWe can now create a new router with extra routes:\n(def router2\n  (add-routes\n    router\n    [[\"/baz/:id/:subid\" ::baz]]))\n\n(r/routes router2)\n;[[\"/foo\" {:name :user/foo}]\n; [\"/bar/:id\" {:name :user/bar}]\n; [\"/baz/:id/:subid\" {:name :user/baz}]]\n\nThe original router was not changed:\n(r/routes router)\n;[[\"/foo\" {:name :user/foo}]\n; [\"/bar/:id\" {:name :user/bar}]]\n\nWhen a new router is created, all rules are applied, including the conflict resolution:\n(add-routes\n  router2\n  [[\"/:this/should/:fail\" ::fail]])\n;CompilerException clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Router contains conflicting route paths:\n;\n;   /baz/:id/:subid\n;-> /:this/should/:fail\n\nMerging routers\nLet's create a helper function to merge routers:\n(defn merge-routers [& routers]\n  (r/router\n    (apply merge (map r/routes routers))\n    (apply merge (map r/options routers))))\n\nWe can now merge multiple routers into one:\n(def router\n  (merge-routers\n    (r/router [\"/route1\" ::route1])\n    (r/router [\"/route2\" ::route2])\n    (r/router [\"/route3\" ::route3])))\n\n(r/routes router)\n;[[\"/route1\" {:name :user/route1}]\n; [\"/route2\" {:name :user/route2}]\n; [\"/route3\" {:name :user/route3}]]\n\nNesting routers\nRouters can be nested using the catch-all parameter.\nHere's a router with deeply nested routers under a :router key in the route data:\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [[\"/ping\" :ping]\n     [\"/olipa/*\" {:name :olipa\n                  :router (r/router\n                            [[\"/olut\" :olut]\n                             [\"/makkara\" :makkara]\n                             [\"/kerran/*\" {:name :kerran\n                                           :router (r/router\n                                                     [[\"/avaruus\" :avaruus]\n                                                      [\"/ihminen\" :ihminen]])}]])}]]))\n\nMatching by path:\n(r/match-by-path router \"/olipa/kerran/iso/kala\")\n;#Match{:template \"/olipa/*\"\n;       :data {:name :olipa\n;              :router #object[reitit.core$mixed_router]}\n;       :result nil\n;       :path-params {: \"kerran/iso/kala\"}\n;       :path \"/olipa/iso/kala\"}\n\nThat didn't work as we wanted, as the nested routers don't have such a route. The core routing doesn't understand anything the :router key, so it only matched against the top-level router, which gave a match for the catch-all path.\nAs the Match contains all the route data, we can create a new matching function that understands the :router key. Below is a function that does recursive matching using the subrouters. It returns either nil or a vector of matches.\n(require '[clojure.string :as str])\n\n(defn recursive-match-by-path [router path]\n  (if-let [match (r/match-by-path router path)]\n    (if-let [subrouter (-> match :data :router)]\n      (let [subpath (subs path (str/last-index-of (:template match) \"/\"))]\n        (if-let [submatch (recursive-match-by-path subrouter subpath)]\n          (cons match submatch)))\n      (list match))))\n\nWith invalid nested path we get now nil as expected:\n(recursive-match-by-path router \"/olipa/kerran/iso/kala\")\n; nil\n\nWith valid path we get all the nested matches:\n(recursive-match-by-path router \"/olipa/kerran/avaruus\")\n;[#reitit.core.Match{:template \"/olipa/*\"\n;                    :data {:name :olipa\n;                           :router #object[reitit.core$mixed_router]}\n;                    :result nil\n;                    :path-params {: \"kerran/avaruus\"}\n;                    :path \"/olipa/kerran/avaruus\"}\n; #reitit.core.Match{:template \"/kerran/*\"\n;                    :data {:name :kerran\n;                           :router #object[reitit.core$lookup_router]}\n;                    :result nil\n;                    :path-params {: \"avaruus\"}\n;                    :path \"/kerran/avaruus\"}\n; #reitit.core.Match{:template \"/avaruus\" \n;                    :data {:name :avaruus} \n;                    :result nil \n;                    :path-params {} \n;                    :path \"/avaruus\"}]\n\nLet's create a helper to get only the route names for matches:\n(defn name-path [router path]\n  (some->> (recursive-match-by-path router path)\n           (mapv (comp :name :data))))\n\n(name-path router \"/olipa/kerran/avaruus\")\n; [:olipa :kerran :avaruus]\n\nSo, we can nest routers, but why would we do that?\nDynamic routing\nIn all the examples above, the routers were created ahead of time, making the whole route tree effectively static.  To have more dynamic routing, we can use router references allowing the router to be swapped over time. We can also create fully dynamic routers where the router is re-created for each request. Let's walk through both cases.\nFirst, we need to modify our matching function to support router references:\n(defn-  match :data :router \nThen, we need some routers.\nFirst, a reference to a router that can be updated on background, for example when a new entry in inserted into a database. We'll wrap the router into a atom:\n(def beer-router\n  (atom\n    (r/router \n      [[\"/lager\" :lager]])))\n\nSecond, a reference to router, which is re-created on each routing request:\n(def dynamic-router\n  (reify clojure.lang.IDeref\n    (deref [_]\n      (r/router\n        [\"/duo\" (keyword (str \"duo\" (rand-int 100)))]))))\n\nWe can compose the routers into a system-level static root router:\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [[\"/gin/napue\" :napue]\n     [\"/ciders/*\" :ciders]\n     [\"/beers/*\" {:name :beers\n                  :router beer-router}]\n     [\"/dynamic/*\" {:name :dynamic\n                    :router dynamic-router}]]))\n\nMatching root routes:\n(name-path router \"/vodka/russian\")\n; nil\n\n(name-path router \"/gin/napue\")\n; [:napue]\n\nMatching (nested) beer routes:\n(name-path router \"/beers/lager\")\n; [:beers :lager]\n\n(name-path router \"/beers/saison\")\n; nil\n\nNo saison!? Let's add the route:\n(swap! beer-router add-routes [[\"/saison\" :saison]])\n\nThere we have it:\n(name-path router \"/beers/saison\")\n; [:beers :saison]\n\nWe can't add conflicting routes:\n(swap! beer-router add-routes [[\"/saison\" :saison]])\n;CompilerException clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Router contains conflicting route paths:\n;\n;   /saison\n;-> /saison\n\nThe dynamic routes are re-created on every request:\n(name-path router \"/dynamic/duo\")\n; [:dynamic :duo71]\n\n(name-path router \"/dynamic/duo\")\n; [:dynamic :duo55]\n\nPerformance\nWith nested routers, instead of having to do just one route match, matching is recursive, which adds a small cost. All nested routers need to be of type catch-all at top-level, which is order of magnitude slower than fully static routes. Dynamic routes are the slowest ones, at least two orders of magnitude slower, as the router needs to be recreated for each request.\nA quick benchmark on the recursive lookups:\n\n\n\npath\ntime\ntype\n\n\n\n\n/gin/napue\n40ns\nstatic\n\n\n/ciders/weston\n440ns\ncatch-all\n\n\n/beers/saison\n600ns\ncatch-all + static\n\n\n/dynamic/duo\n12000ns\ncatch-all + dynamic\n\n\n\nThe non-recursive lookup for /gin/napue is around 23ns.\nComparing the dynamic routing performance with Compojure:\n(require '[compojure.core :refer [context])\n\n(def app\n  (context \"/dynamic\" [] (constantly :duo)))\n\n(app {:uri \"/dynamic/duo\" :request-method :get})\n; :duo\n\n\n\n\npath\ntime\ntype\n\n\n\n\n/dynamic/duo\n20000ns\ncompojure\n\n\n\nCan we make the nester routing faster? Sure. We could use the Router :compile hook to compile the nested routers for better performance. We could also allow router creation rules to be disabled, to get the dynamic routing much faster.\nWhen to use nested routers?\nNesting routers is not trivial and because of that, should be avoided. For dynamic (request-time) route generation, it's the only choise. For other cases, nested routes are most likely a better option.\nLet's re-create the previous example with normal route nesting/composition.\nA helper to the root router:\n(defn create-router [beers]\n  (r/router\n    [[\"/gin/napue\" :napue]\n     [\"/ciders/*\" :ciders]\n     [\"/beers\" (for [beer beers]\n                 [(str \"/\" beer) (keyword \"beer\" beer)])]\n     [\"/dynamic/*\" {:name :dynamic\n                    :router dynamic-router}]]))\n\nNew new root router reference and a helper to reset it:\n(def router\n  (atom (create-router nil)))\n\n(defn reset-router! [beers]\n  (reset! router (create-router beers)))\n\nThe routing tree:\n(r/routes @router)\n;[[\"/gin/napue\" {:name :napue}]\n; [\"/ciders/*\" {:name :ciders}]\n; [\"/dynamic/*\" {:name :dynamic,\n;                :router #object[user$reify__24359]}]]\n\nLet's reset the router with some beers:\n(reset-router! [\"lager\" \"sahti\" \"bock\"])\n\nWe can see that the beer routes are now embedded into the core router:\n(r/routes @router)\n;[[\"/gin/napue\" {:name :napue}]\n; [\"/ciders/*\" {:name :ciders}]\n; [\"/beers/lager\" {:name :beer/lager}]\n; [\"/beers/sahti\" {:name :beer/sahti}]\n; [\"/beers/bock\" {:name :beer/bock}]\n; [\"/dynamic/*\" {:name :dynamic,\n;                :router #object[user$reify__24359]}]]\n\nAnd the routing works:\n(name-path @router \"/beers/sahti\")\n;[:beer/sahti]\n\nAll the beer-routes now match in constant time.\n\n\n\npath\ntime\ntype\n\n\n\n\n/beers/sahti\n40ns\nstatic\n\n\n\nTODO\n\nadd an example how to do dynamic routing with reitit-ring\nmaybe create a recursive-router into a separate ns with all Router functions implemented correctly? maybe not...\nadd reitit.core/merge-routes to effectively merge routes with route data\n\n"},"advanced/different_routers.html":{"url":"advanced/different_routers.html","title":"Different Routers","keywords":"","body":"Different Routers\nReitit ships with several different implementations for the Router protocol, originally based on the Pedestal implementation. router function selects the most suitable implementation by inspecting the expanded routes.

It defaults to reitit.core/expand multimethod.\nFirst, define the common routes (in a .cljc file):\n(def routes\n  [[\"/kikka\" ::kikka]\n   [\"/bar\" ::bar]])\n\nThose can be used as-is from ClojureScript:\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router routes))\n\n(r/match-by-name router ::kikka)\n;#Match{:template \"/kikka\"\n;       :data {:name :user/kikka}\n;       :result nil\n;       :path-params nil\n;       :path \"/kikka\"}\n\nFor the backend, we can use a custom-expander to expand the routes:\n(require '[reitit.ring :as ring])\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n\n(defn my-expand [registry]\n  (fn [data opts]\n    (if (keyword? data)\n      (some-> data\n              registry\n              (r/expand opts)\n              (assoc :name data))\n      (r/expand data opts))))\n\n;; the handler functions\n(defn get-kikka [_] {:status 200, :body \"get\"})\n(defn post-kikka [_] {:status 200, :body \"post\"})\n(defn bar [_] {:status 200, :body \"bar\"})\n\n(def app\n  (ring/ring-handler\n    (ring/router\n      [[\"/kikka\" ::kikka]\n       [\"/bar\" ::bar]]\n      ;; use a custom expander\n      {:expand (my-expand\n                 {::kikka {:get get-kikka\n                           :post post-kikka}\n                  ::bar bar})})))\n\n(app {:request-method :post, :uri \"/kikka\"})\n; {:status 200, :body \"post\"}\n\n"},"performance.html":{"url":"performance.html","title":"Performance","keywords":"","body":"Performance\nReitit tries to be really, really fast.\n\nRationale\n\nMultiple routing algorithms, chosen based on the route tree\nRoute flattening and re-ordering\nManaged mutability over immutability\nPrecompute/compile as much as possible (matches, middleware, interceptors, routes, path-parameter sets)\nUse abstractions that enable JVM optimizations\nUse small functions to enable JVM Inlining\nUse Java where needed\nProtocols over Multimethods\nRecords over Maps\nAlways be measuring\nDon't trust the (micro-)benchmarks\n\nDoes routing performance matter?\nWell, it depends. With small route trees, it might not. But, with large (real-life) route trees, difference between the fastest and the slowest tested libs can be two or three orders of magnitude. For busy sites it actually matters if you routing request takes 100 ns or 100 Âµs. A lot.\nTests\nAll perf tests are found in the repo and have been run with the following setup:\n;;\n;; start repl with `lein perf repl`\n;; perf measured with the following setup:\n;;\n;; Model Name:            MacBook Pro\n;; Model Identifier:      MacBookPro11,3\n;; Processor Name:        Intel Core i7\n;; Processor Speed:       2,5 GHz\n;; Number of Processors:  1\n;; Total Number of Cores: 4\n;; L2 Cache (per Core):   256 KB\n;; L3 Cache:              6 MB\n;; Memory:                16 GB\n;;\nNOTE: Tests are not scientific proof and may contain errors. You should always run the perf tests with your own (real-life) routing tables to get more accurate results for your use case. Also, if you have idea how to test things better, please let us know.\nSimple Example\nThe routing sample taken from bide README:\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n(require '[criterium.core :as cc])\n\n(def routes\n  (r/router\n    [[\"/auth/login\" :auth/login]\n     [\"/auth/recovery/token/:token\" :auth/recovery]\n     [\"/workspace/:project/:page\" :workspace/page]]))\n\n;; Execution time mean (per 1000) : 3.2 Âµs -> 312M ops/sec\n(cc/quick-bench\n  (dotimes [_ 1000]\n    (r/match-by-path routes \"/auth/login\")))\n\n;; Execution time mean (per 1000): 115 Âµs -> 8.7M ops/sec\n(cc/quick-bench\n  (dotimes [_ 1000]\n    (r/match-by-path routes \"/workspace/1/1\")))\n\nBased on the perf tests, the first (static path) lookup is 300-500x faster and the second (wildcard path) lookup is 18-110x faster that the other tested routing libs (Ataraxy, Bidi, Compojure and Pedestal).\nBut, the example is too simple for any real benchmark. Also, some of the libraries always match on the :request-method too and by doing so, do more work than just match by path. Compojure does most work also by invoking the handler.\nSo, we need to test something more realistic.\nRESTful apis\nTo get better view on the real life routing performance, there is test of a mid-size rest(ish) http api with 50+ routes, having a lot of path parameters. The route definitions are pulled off from the OpenSensors swagger definitions.\nThanks to the snappy Wildcard  Trie (a modification of Radix Tree), reitit-ring is fastest here. Calfpath and Pedestal are also quite fast.\n\nCQRS apis\nAnother real-life test scenario is a CQRS style route tree, where all the paths are static, e.g. /api/command/add-order. The 300 route definitions are pulled out from Lupapiste.\nBoth reitit-ring and Pedestal shine in this test, thanks to the fast lookup-routers. On average, they are two and on best case, three orders of magnitude faster than the other tested libs. Ataraxy failed this test on Method code too large! error.\n\nNOTE: in real life, there are usually always also wild-card routes present. In this case, Pedestal would fallback from lookup-router to the prefix-tree router, which is order of magnitude slower (30x in this test). Reitit would handle this nicely thanks to it's :mixed-router: all static routes would still be served with :lookup-router, just the wildcard routes with :segment-tree. The performance would not notably degrade.\nPath conflicts\nTODO\nWhy measure?\nThe reitit routing perf is measured to get an internal baseline to optimize against. We also want to ensure that new features don't regress the performance. Perf tests should be run in a stable CI environment. Help welcome!\nLooking out of the box\nA quick poke to the fast routers in Go indicates that reitit is less 50% slower than the fastest routers in Go. Which is kinda awesome.\nFaster!\nBy default, reitit.ring/ring-router, reitit.http/ring-router and reitit.http/routing-interceptor inject both Match and Router into the request. You can remove the injections setting options :inject-match? and :inject-router? to false. This saves some tens of nanos (with the hw described above).\n(require '[reitit.ring :as ring])\n(require '[criterium.core :as cc])\n\n(defn create [options]\n  (ring/ring-handler\n    (ring/router\n      [\"/ping\" (constantly {:status 200, :body \"ok\"})])\n    (ring/create-default-handler)\n    options))\n\n;; 130ns\n(let [app (create nil)]\n  (cc/quick-bench\n    (app {:request-method :get, :uri \"/ping\"})))\n\n;; 80ns\n(let [app (create {:inject-router? false, :inject-match? false})]\n  (cc/quick-bench\n    (app {:request-method :get, :uri \"/ping\"})))\n\nNOTE: Without Router, you can't to do reverse routing and without Match you can't write dynamic extensions.\nPerformance tips\nFew things that have an effect on performance:\n\nWildcard-routes are an order of magnitude slower than static routes\nConflicting routes are served with LinearRouter, which is the slowest implementation.\nIt's ok to mix non-wildcard, wildcard or even conflicting routes in a same routing tree. Reitit will create an hierarchy of routers to serve all the routes with best possible implementation. \nMove computation from request processing time into creation time, using by compiling middleware, interceptors and route data.\nUnmounted middleware (or interceptor) is infinitely faster than a mounted one effectively doing nothing.\n\n\n\n"},"development.html":{"url":"development.html","title":"Development Instructions","keywords":"","body":"Development Instructions\nBuilding\n./scripts/lein-modules do clean, install\n\nRunning tests\n./scripts/test.sh clj\n./scripts/test.sh cljs\n\nDocumentation\nThe documentation is built with gitbook.

There are already many good routing libs for Clojure, but we felt none was perfect. So, we took best parts of existing libs and added features that were missing: first-class composable route data, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion. Goal was to make a data-driven library that works, is fun to use and is really, really fast.\nHow can I contribute?\nYou can join #reitit channel in Clojurians slack to discuss things. Known roadmap is mostly written in issues.\nHow does Reitit differ from Bidi?\nBidi is an great and proven library for ClojureScript and we have been using it in many of our frontend projects. Both Reitit and Bidi are data-driven, bi-directional and work with both Clojure & ClojureScript. Here are the main differences:\nRoute syntax\n\nBidi supports multiple representations for route syntax, Reitit supports just one (simple) syntax.\nBidi uses special (Clojure) syntax for route patterns while Reitit separates (human-readable) paths strings from route data - still exposing the machine-readable syntax for extensions.\n\nBidi:\n(def routes\n  [\"/\" [[\"auth/login\" :auth/login]\n        [[\"auth/recovery/token/\" :token] :auth/recovery]\n        [\"workspace/\" [[[:project-uuid \"/\" :page-uuid] :workspace/page]]]]])\n\nReitit:\n(def routes\n  [[\"/auth/login\" :auth/login]\n   [\"/auth/recovery/token/:token\" :auth/recovery]\n   [\"/workspace/:project-uuid/:page-uuid\" :workspace/page]])\n\nFeatures\n\nBidi has extra features like route guards\nReitit ships with composable route data, specs, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion.\n\nPerformance\n\nBidi is not optimized for speed and thus, Reitit is much faster than Bidi. From Bidi source:\n\n;; Route compilation was only marginally effective and hard to\n;; debug. When bidi matching takes in the order of 30 micro-seconds,\n;; this is good enough in relation to the time taken to process the\n;; overall request.\n\nHow does Reitit differ from Pedestal?\nPedestal is an great and proven library and has had great influence in Reitit. Both Reitit and Pedestal are data-driven and provide bi-directional routing and fast. Here are the main differences:\nClojureScript\n\nPedestal targets only Clojure, while Reitit works also with ClojureScript.\n\nRoute syntax\n\nPedestal supports multiple representations for route syntax: terse, table and verbose. Reitit provides only one representation.\nPedestal supports both maps or keyword-arguments in route data, in Reitit, it's all maps.\n\nPedestal:\n[\"/api/ping\" :get identity :route-name ::ping]\n\nReitit:\n[\"/api/ping\" {:get identity, :name ::ping}]\n\nFeatures\n\nPedestal supports route guards\nPedestal supports interceptors (reitit-http module will support them too).\nReitit ships with composable route data, specs, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion.\nIn Pedestal, different routers behave differently, in Reitit, all work the same.\n\nPerformance\nReitit routing was originally based on Pedestal Routing an thus they same similar performance. For routing trees with both static and wildcard routes, Reitit is much faster thanks to it's mixed-router algorithm.\nHow does Reitit differ from Compojure?\nCompojure is the most used routing library in Clojure. It's proven and awesome.\nClojureScript\n\nCompojure targets only Clojure, while Reitit works also with ClojureScript.\n\nRoute syntax\n\nCompojure uses routing functions and macros while reitit is all data\nCompojure allows easy destructuring of route params on mid-path\nApplying middleware for sub-paths is hacky on Compojure, reitit-ring resolves this with data-driven middleware\n\nCompojure:\n(defroutes routes\n  (wrap-routes\n    (context \"/api\" []\n      (GET \"/users/:id\" [id :\nreitit-ring with reitit-spec module:\n(def routes\n  [\"/api\" {:middleware [[wrap-api :secure]]}\n   [\"/users/:id\" {:get {:parameters {:path {:id int?}}}\n                  :handler (fn [{:keys [parameters]}]\n                             (ok (get-user (-> parameters :body :id))))}\n    [\"/pizza\" {:post {:middleware [wrap-log]\n                      :handler post-pizza-handler}]]])\n\nFeatures\n\nDynamic routing is trivial in Compojure, with reitit, some trickery is needed\nReitit ships with composable route data, specs, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion.\n\nPerformance\nReitit is much faster than Compojure.\n"}}}
