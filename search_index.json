There can be multiple Coercion implementations within a single router, normal scoping rules apply.\nDefining parameters\nRoute parameters can be defined via route data :parameters. It has keys for different type of parameters: :query, :body, :form, :header and :path. Syntax for the actual parameters depends on the Coercion implementation.\nExample with Schema path-parameters:\n(require '[reitit.coercion.schema])\n(require '[schema.core :as s])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [\"/:company/users/:user-id\" {:name ::user-view\n                                 :coercion reitit.coercion.schema/coercion\n                                 :parameters {:path {:company s/Str\n                                                     :user-id s/Int}}}]))\n\nA Match:\n(r/match-by-path r \"/metosin/users/123\")\n; #Match{:template \"/:company/users/:user-id\",\n;        :data {:name :user/user-view,\n;               :coercion >\n;               :parameters {:path {:company java.lang.String,\n;                                   :user-id Int}}},\n;        :result nil,\n;        :path-params {:company \"metosin\", :user-id \"123\"},\n;        :path \"/metosin/users/123\"}\n\nCoercion was not applied. Why? In Reitit, routing and coercion are separate processes and we have done just the routing part. We need to apply coercion after the successful routing.\nBut now we should have enough data on the match to apply the coercion.\nCompiling coercers\nBefore the actual coercion, we should need to compile the coercers against the route data. Compiled coercers yield much better performance and the manual step of adding a coercion compiler makes things explicit and non-magical.\nCompiling can be done via a Middleware, Interceptor or a Router. We apply it now at router-level, effecting all routes (with :parameters and :coercion defined).\nThere is a helper function reitit.coercion/compile-request-coercers just for this:\n(require '[reitit.coercion :as coercion])\n(require '[reitit.coercion.schema])\n(require '[schema.core :as s])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [\"/:company/users/:user-id\" {:name ::user-view\n                                 :coercion reitit.coercion.schema/coercion\n                                 :parameters {:path {:company s/Str\n                                                     :user-id s/Int}}}]\n    {:compile coercion/compile-request-coercers}))\n\nRouting again:\n(r/match-by-path r \"/metosin/users/123\")\n; #Match{:template \"/:company/users/:user-id\",\n;        :data {:name :user/user-view,\n;               :coercion >\n;               :parameters {:path {:company java.lang.String,\n;                                   :user-id Int}}},\n;        :result {:path #object[reitit.coercion$request_coercer$]},\n;        :path-params {:company \"metosin\", :user-id \"123\"},\n;        :path \"/metosin/users/123\"}\n\nThe compiler added a :result key into the match (done just once, at router creation time), which holds the compiled coercers. We are almost done.\nApplying coercion\nWe can use a helper function reitit.coercion/coerce! to do the actual coercion, based on a Match:\n(coercion/coerce!\n  (r/match-by-path router \"/metosin/users/123\"))\n; {:path {:company \"metosin\", :user-id 123}}\n\nWe get the coerced paremeters back. If a coercion fails, a typed (:reitit.coercion/request-coercion) ExceptionInfo is thrown, with data about the actual error:\n(coercion/coerce!\n  (r/match-by-path router \"/metosin/users/ikitommi\"))\n; => ExceptionInfo Request coercion failed:\n; #CoercionError{:schema {:company java.lang.String, :user-id Int, Any Any},\n;                :errors {:user-id (not (integer? \"ikitommi\"))}}\n; clojure.core/ex-info (core.clj:4739)\n\nFull example\nHere's an full example for doing routing and coercion with Reitit and Schema:\n(require '[reitit.coercion.schema])\n(require '[reitit.coercion :as coercion])\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n(require '[schema.core :as s])\n\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [\"/:company/users/:user-id\" {:name ::user-view\n                                 :coercion reitit.coercion.schema/coercion\n                                 :parameters {:path {:company s/Str\n                                                     :user-id s/Int}}}]\n    {:compile coercion/compile-request-coercers}))\n\n(defn match-by-path-and-coerce!

To enable fast lookups into route data, we can compile them into any shape (records, functions etc.) we want, enabling fast access at request-time.\nBut, we can do much better. As we know the exact route that middleware/interceptor is linked to, we can pass the (compiled) route information into the middleware at creation-time. It can do local reasoning: extract and transform relevant data just for it and pass the optimized data into the actual request-handler via a closure - yielding much faster runtime processing. Middleware can also decide not to mount itself by returning nil. Why mount a wrap-enforce-roles middleware for a route if there are no roles required for it?\nTo enable this we use middleware records :compile key instead of the normal :wrap. :compile expects a function of route-data router-opts => ?IntoMiddleware.\nTo demonstrate the two approaches, below are response coercion middleware written as normal ring middleware function and as middleware record with :compile.\nNormal Middleware\n\nReads the compiled route information on every request.

To have more dynamic routing, we can use router references allowing the router to be swapped over time. We can also create fully dynamic routers where the router is re-created for each request. Let's walk through both cases.\nFirst, we need to modify our matching function to support router references:\n(defn-  match :data :router \nThen, we need some routers.\nFirst, a reference to a router that can be updated on background, for example when a new entry in inserted into a database. We'll wrap the router into a atom:\n(def beer-router\n  (atom\n    (r/router \n      [[\"/lager\" :lager]])))\n\nSecond, a reference to router, which is re-created on each routing request:\n(def dynamic-router\n  (reify clojure.lang.IDeref\n    (deref [_]\n      (r/router\n        [\"/duo\" (keyword (str \"duo\" (rand-int 100)))]))))\n\nWe can compose the routers into a system-level static root router:\n(def router\n  (r/router\n    [[\"/gin/napue\" :napue]\n     [\"/ciders/*\" :ciders]\n     [\"/beers/*\" {:name :beers\n                  :router beer-router}]\n     [\"/dynamic/*\" {:name :dynamic\n                    :router dynamic-router}]]))\n\nMatching root routes:\n(name-path router \"/vodka/russian\")\n; nil\n\n(name-path router \"/gin/napue\")\n; [:napue]\n\nMatching (nested) beer routes:\n(name-path router \"/beers/lager\")\n; [:beers :lager]\n\n(name-path router \"/beers/saison\")\n; nil\n\nNo saison!? Let's add the route:\n(swap! beer-router add-routes [[\"/saison\" :saison]])\n\nThere we have it:\n(name-path router \"/beers/saison\")\n; [:beers :saison]\n\nWe can't add conflicting routes:\n(swap! beer-router add-routes [[\"/saison\" :saison]])\n;CompilerException clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Router contains conflicting route paths:\n;\n;   /saison\n;-> /saison\n\nThe dynamic routes are re-created on every request:\n(name-path router \"/dynamic/duo\")\n; [:dynamic :duo71]\n\n(name-path router \"/dynamic/duo\")\n; [:dynamic :duo55]\n\nPerformance\nWith nested routers, instead of having to do just one route match, matching is recursive, which adds a small cost. All nested routers need to be of type catch-all at top-level, which is order of magnitude slower than fully static routes. Dynamic routes are the slowest ones, at least two orders of magnitude slower, as the router needs to be recreated for each request.\nA quick benchmark on the recursive lookups:\n\n\n\npath\ntime\ntype\n\n\n\n\n/gin/napue\n40ns\nstatic\n\n\n/ciders/weston\n440ns\ncatch-all\n\n\n/beers/saison\n600ns\ncatch-all + static\n\n\n/dynamic/duo\n12000ns\ncatch-all + dynamic\n\n\n\nThe non-recursive lookup for /gin/napue is around 23ns.\nComparing the dynamic routing performance with Compojure:\n(require '[compojure.core :refer [context])\n\n(def app\n  (context \"/dynamic\" [] (constantly :duo)))\n\n(app {:uri \"/dynamic/duo\" :request-method :get})\n; :duo\n\n\n\n\npath\ntime\ntype\n\n\n\n\n/dynamic/duo\n20000ns\ncompojure\n\n\n\nCan we make the nester routing faster? Sure. We could use the Router :compile hook to compile the nested routers for better performance. We could also allow router creation rules to be disabled, to get the dynamic routing much faster.\nWhen to use nested routers?\nNesting routers is not trivial and because of that, should be avoided. For dynamic (request-time) route generation, it's the only choise. For other cases, nested routes are most likely a better option.\nLet's re-create the previous example with normal route nesting/composition.\nA helper to the root router:\n(defn create-router [beers]\n  (r/router\n    [[\"/gin/napue\" :napue]\n     [\"/ciders/*\" :ciders]\n     [\"/beers\" (for [beer beers]\n                 [(str \"/\" beer) (keyword \"beer\" beer)])]\n     [\"/dynamic/*\" {:name :dynamic\n                    :router dynamic-router}]]))\n\nNew new root router reference and a helper to reset it:\n(def router\n  (atom (create-router nil)))\n\n(defn reset-router! [beers]\n  (reset! router (create-router beers)))\n\nThe routing tree:\n(r/routes @router)\n;[[\"/gin/napue\" {:name :napue}]\n; [\"/ciders/*\" {:name :ciders}]\n; [\"/dynamic/*\" {:name :dynamic,\n;                :router #object[user$reify__24359]}]]\n\nLet's reset the router with some beers:\n(reset-router! [\"lager\" \"sahti\" \"bock\"])\n\nWe can see that the beer routes are now embedded into the core router:\n(r/routes @router)\n;[[\"/gin/napue\" {:name :napue}]\n; [\"/ciders/*\" {:name :ciders}]\n; [\"/beers/lager\" {:name :beer/lager}]\n; [\"/beers/sahti\" {:name :beer/sahti}]\n; [\"/beers/bock\" {:name :beer/bock}]\n; [\"/dynamic/*\" {:name :dynamic,\n;                :router #object[user$reify__24359]}]]\n\nAnd the routing works:\n(name-path @router \"/beers/sahti\")\n;[:beer/sahti]\n\nAll the beer-routes now match in constant time.\n\n\n\npath\ntime\ntype\n\n\n\n\n/beers/sahti\n40ns\nstatic\n\n\n\nTODO\n\nadd an example how to do dynamic routing with reitit-ring\nmaybe create a recursive-router into a separate ns with all Router functions implemented correctly? maybe not...\nadd reitit.core/merge-routes to effectively merge routes with route data\n\n"},"advanced/different_routers.html":{"url":"advanced/different_routers.html","title":"Different Routers","keywords":"","body":"Different Routers\nReitit ships with several different implementations for the Router protocol, originally based on the Pedestal implementation. router function selects the most suitable implementation by inspecting the expanded routes.

With small route trees, it might not. But, with large (real-life) route trees, difference between the fastest and the slowest tested libs can be two or three orders of magnitude. For busy sites it actually matters if you routing request takes 100 ns or 100 Âµs. A lot.\nTests\nAll perf tests are found in the repo and have been run with the following setup:\n;;\n;; start repl with `lein perf repl`\n;; perf measured with the following setup:\n;;\n;; Model Name:            MacBook Pro\n;; Model Identifier:      MacBookPro11,3\n;; Processor Name:        Intel Core i7\n;; Processor Speed:       2,5 GHz\n;; Number of Processors:  1\n;; Total Number of Cores: 4\n;; L2 Cache (per Core):   256 KB\n;; L3 Cache:              6 MB\n;; Memory:                16 GB\n;;\nNOTE: Tests are not scientific proof and may contain errors. You should always run the perf tests with your own (real-life) routing tables to get more accurate results for your use case. Also, if you have idea how to test things better, please let us know.\nSimple Example\nThe routing sample taken from bide README:\n(require '[reitit.core :as r])\n(require '[criterium.core :as cc])\n\n(def routes\n  (r/router\n    [[\"/auth/login\" :auth/login]\n     [\"/auth/recovery/token/:token\" :auth/recovery]\n     [\"/workspace/:project/:page\" :workspace/page]]))\n\n;; Execution time mean (per 1000) : 3.2 Âµs -> 312M ops/sec\n(cc/quick-bench\n  (dotimes [_ 1000]\n    (r/match-by-path routes \"/auth/login\")))\n\n;; Execution time mean (per 1000): 530 Âµs -> 1.9M ops/sec\n(cc/quick-bench\n  (dotimes [_ 1000]\n    (r/match-by-path routes \"/workspace/1/1\")))\n\nBased on the perf tests, the first (static path) lookup is 300-500x faster and the second (wildcard path) lookup is 4-24x faster that the other tested routing libs (Ataraxy, Bidi, Compojure and Pedestal).\nBut, the example is too simple for any real benchmark. Also, some of the libraries always match on the :request-method too and by doing so, do more work than just match by path. Compojure does most work also by invoking the handler.\nSo, we need to test something more realistic.\nRESTful apis\nTo get better view on the real life routing performance, there is test of a mid-size rest(ish) http api with 50+ routes, having a lot of path parameters. The route definitions are pulled off from the OpenSensors swagger definitions.\nThanks to the snappy new segment-tree algorithm, reitit-ring is fastest here. Pedestal is also fast with it's prefix-tree implementation.\n\nCQRS apis\nAnother real-life test scenario is a CQRS-style route tree, where all the paths are static, e.g. /api/command/add-order. The 300 route definitions are pulled out from Lupapiste.\nBoth reitit-ring and Pedestal shine in this test, thanks to the fast lookup-routers. On average, they are two and on best case, three orders of magnitude faster than the other tested libs. Ataraxy failed this test on Method code too large! error.\n\nNOTE: in real life, there are usually always also wild-card routes present. In this case, Pedestal would fallback from lookup-router to the prefix-tree router, which is order of magnitude slower (30x in this test). Reitit would handle this nicely thanks to it's :mixed-router: all static routes would still be served with :lookup-router, just the wildcard routes with :segment-tree. The performance would not notably degrade.\nWhy measure?\nThe reitit routing perf is measured to get an internal baseline to optimize against. We also want to ensure that new features don't regress the performance. Perf tests should be run in a stable CI environment. Help welcome!\nLooking out of the box\nA quick poke to routers in Go indicates that the reitit is only few times slower than the fastest routers in Go. Which is really awesome (if true).\nPerformance tips\nFew things that have an effect on performance:\n\nWildcard-routes are an order of magnitude slower than static routes\nIt's ok to mix non-wildcard and wildcard routes in a same routing tree as long as you don't disable the conflict resolution => if no conflicting routes are found, a :mixed-router can be created, which internally has a fast static path router and a separate wildcard-router. So, the static paths are still fast.\nMove computation from request processing time into creation time, using by compiling middleware & route data.\nUnmounted middleware (or interceptor) is infinitely faster than a mounted one effectively doing nothing.\n\n\n\n"},"development.html":{"url":"development.html","title":"Development Instructions","keywords":"","body":"Development Instructions\nBuilding\n./scripts/lein-modules do clean, install\n\nRunning tests\n./scripts/test.sh clj\n./scripts/test.sh cljs\n\nDocumentation\nThe documentation is built with gitbook.

Goal was to make a data-driven library that works, is fun to use and is really, really fast.\nHow can I contribute?\nYou can join #reitit channel in Clojurians slack to discuss things. Known roadmap is mostly written in issues.\nHow does Reitit differ from Bidi?\nBidi is an great and proven library for ClojureScript and we have been using it in many of our frontend projects. Both Reitit and Bidi are data-driven, bi-directional and work with both Clojure & ClojureScript. Here are the main differences:\nRoute syntax\n\nBidi supports multiple representations for route syntax, Reitit supports just one (simple) syntax.\nBidi uses special (Clojure) syntax for route patterns while Reitit separates (human-readable) paths strings from route data - still exposing the machine-readable syntax for extensions.\n\nBidi:\n(def routes\n  [\"/\" [[\"auth/login\" :auth/login]\n        [[\"auth/recovery/token/\" :token] :auth/recovery]\n        [\"workspace/\" [[[:project-uuid \"/\" :page-uuid] :workspace/page]]]]])\n\nReitit:\n(def routes\n  [[\"/auth/login\" :auth/login]\n   [\"/auth/recovery/token/:token\" :auth/recovery]\n   [\"/workspace/:project-uuid/:page-uuid\" :workspace/page]])\n\nFeatures\n\nBidi has extra features like route guards\nReitit ships with composable route data, specs, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion.\n\nPerformance\n\nBidi is not optimized for speed and thus, Reitit is much faster than Bidi. From Bidi source:\n\n;; Route compilation was only marginally effective and hard to\n;; debug. When bidi matching takes in the order of 30 micro-seconds,\n;; this is good enough in relation to the time taken to process the\n;; overall request.\n\nHow does Reitit differ from Pedestal?\nPedestal is an great and proven library and has had great influence in Reitit. Both Reitit and Pedestal are data-driven and provide bi-directional routing and fast. Here are the main differences:\nClojureScript\n\nPedestal targets only Clojure, while Reitit works also with ClojureScript.\n\nRoute syntax\n\nPedestal supports multiple representations for route syntax: terse, table and verbose. Reitit provides only one representation.\nPedestal supports both maps or keyword-arguments in route data, in Reitit, it's all maps.\n\nPedestal:\n[\"/api/ping\" :get identity :route-name ::ping]\n\nReitit:\n[\"/api/ping\" {:get identity, :name ::ping}]\n\nFeatures\n\nPedestal supports route guards\nPedestal supports interceptors (reitit-http module will support them too).\nReitit ships with composable route data, specs, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion.\nIn Pedestal, different routers behave differently, in Reitit, all work the same.\n\nPerformance\nReitit routing was originally based on Pedestal Routing an thus they same similar performance. For routing trees with both static and wildcard routes, Reitit is much faster thanks to it's mixed-router algorithm.\nHow does Reitit differ from Compojure?\nCompojure is the most used routing library in Clojure. It's proven and awesome.\nClojureScript\n\nCompojure targets only Clojure, while Reitit works also with ClojureScript.\n\nRoute syntax\n\nCompojure uses routing functions and macros while reitit is all data\nCompojure allows easy destructuring of route params on mid-path\nApplying middleware for sub-paths is hacky on Compojure, reitit-ring resolves this with data-driven middleware\n\nCompojure:\n(defroutes routes\n  (wrap-routes\n    (context \"/api\" []\n      (GET \"/users/:id\" [id :\nreitit-ring with reitit-spec module:\n(def routes\n  [\"/api\" {:middleware [[wrap-api :secure]]}\n   [\"/users/:id\" {:get {:parameters {:path {:id int?}}}\n                  :handler (fn [{:keys [parameters]}]\n                             (ok (get-user (-> parameters :body :id))))}\n    [\"/pizza\" {:post {:middleware [wrap-log]\n                      :handler post-pizza-handler}]]])\n\nFeatures\n\nDynamic routing is trivial in Compojure, with reitit, some trickery is needed\nReitit ships with composable route data, specs, full route conflict resolution and pluggable coercion.\n\nPerformance\nReitit is much faster than Compojure.\n"}}}
