# Swagger & OpenAPI

Goal is to support both [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) & [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specifications for route documentation.

Swagge-support draft works, but only for Clojure.

TODO:

* [metosin/schema-tools#38](https://github.com/metosin/schema-tools/issues/38): extract Schema-swagger from [ring-swagger](https://github.com/metosin/ring-swagger) into [schema-tools](https://github.com/metosin/schema-tools) to support both Clojure & ClojureScript
* separate modules for the swagger2 & openapi
* [metosin/spec-tools#105](https://github.com/metosin/spec-tools/issues/105): support OpenApi
